//   1. draw every table as real HTML

//   3. hand the measurements to the layout engine

//
// What the page is handed is a data dictionary as `data-dict render` exports
// it, embedded as-is (parsed once in shared.js): table and column names, row
// counts, resolved `constraints`, and relationships with their column `pairs`
// worked out and their sides normalised so `left` is always the many end.
// Everything below reads that document directly.
//
// Anything empty is left out of the export rather than spelled as null, so a
// dictionary with no relationships has no `relationships`, and a column under no
// constraint has no `constraints`.
//
// LAYOUT(dict, metrics, width, was) resolves to
//   { engine, width, height, note, nodes: {id: {x, y, width, height}}, edges: [{ rel }] }
// with x/y as top-left corners in stage coordinates. Wires are routed here, not
// there, so no edge geometry crosses the boundary.
//
// `metrics` holds only the tables on the board, which is how tables are taken off
// it: the layout places what it was given and never has to know why. `was` is the
// previous layout's positions, or null for a layout from scratch.
//
// The whole engine lives inside DIAGRAM_INIT, which the app's
// RelationshipsDiagram component calls once its skeleton is in the document —
// and only when the dictionary has relationships to draw. Its names are
// scoped to the function; the deliberate globals (LAYOUT's inputs REL_ENDS
