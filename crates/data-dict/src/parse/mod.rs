//! Reading an expression written in another language into the language's own
//! [surface AST](crate::assert_expr::AssertExpr).
//!
//! The mirror of [`emit`](crate::emit), and deliberately not built like it.
//! `emit` has a shared driver — [`emit`](crate::emit::emit) walks one IR and
//! calls back into a [`Target`](crate::emit::Target) for each node's spelling —
//! so a trait earns its keep there. There is no inbound equivalent: two source
//! languages share no tokenizer, no grammar, and no precedence table, so a
//! `Source` trait would have exactly one method and buy nothing. A reader is a
//! function, and [`Language`] is a name attached to one.
//!
//! # What a reader produces
//!
//! The **surface** AST, not the [typed IR](crate::assert_expr::TypedAssertion).
//! Everything downstream then works unchanged — most importantly
//! [`check`](crate::assert_expr::check), so `nchar(nope) > 0` reports the
//! ordinary S20 for an unknown column rather than needing a reader of its own to
//! resolve names. It also keeps a reader free of the table it will be checked
//! against, preserving the invariant `assert_expr` states: parsing is pure
//! syntax. That pays for itself — `as.Date("2020-01-01")` reads as a plain
//! string, and lowering turns it back into a date when it meets a `date` column,
//! by the rule the language already has.
//!
//! # Spans
//!
//! A node's span points into the **source text that was parsed**, so for a
//! reader it points into the R, not into any data-dict spelling. A node built by
//! folding several R nodes together spans from the first byte of the leftmost
//! contributing token to the last byte of the rightmost.
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! Where a construct means something slightly different in its own language
//! than the reading it is given, the difference travels as a note. Notes are
//! collected here rather than hung on the AST, which has nowhere to put them —
//! the same shape [`Emitted`](crate::emit::Emitted) uses going the other way.
//!
//! A reader never repairs such a difference by adding a guard. See
//! `site/expression-execution.md#fidelity` for why: emitted code is for a
//! machine to run, where an added guard is invisible and welcome, but a reading
//! becomes the dictionary's own statement of the rule, which its author has to
//! be able to recognise as theirs.
