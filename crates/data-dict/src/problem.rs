//! A single problem vocabulary for every validation level.
//!
//! A [`Problem`] is anything that can be wrong while validating — a failed spec
//! check, a column that disagrees with the data, an unreadable file. They vary
//! only on where the problem points (a YAML span / a named column / nowhere) and
//! what structured payload they carry; a code, a severity, and a message are
//! common to all. The structured payload is the flattened
//! [`ProblemKind`] tag, so a single `#[derive(Serialize)]` produces the JSON for
//! every kind uniformly.
//!
//! There is no `fatal` field by design: a problem that must stop the run is the
//! last thing a level pushes before returning, and a problem that blocks the
//! next level is caught by the driver checking [`ProblemSet::status`] before
//! descending. Fatality is control flow, not data.
