# Expressions

data-dict provides a small expression language: a SQL-like sublanguage for describing computations. You use expression wherever a dictionary needs to express something that a keyword can't, for example, in a [constraint](spec.md#column-constraints), or [definition](spec.md#definitions):

```yaml
tables:
  - name: survey
    constraints:
      - assert: end_date >= start_date
        description: A contract can't end before it starts.
    columns:
      - name: postcode
        type: string
        constraints:
          - required
          - assert: LENGTH(postcode) <= 10
    definitions:
      - name: complete
        description: Respondents who answered every question.
        expr: COLUMNS('q[1-8]') IS NOT NULL
```

An expression is always written against the columns of one table: bare names are that table's column names, and an expression on a column sees every other column too. So the two constraints above differ in where they're written, not in what they can say — a column constraint sits next to the column it's mostly about, and a table constraint is the natural home for a rule that spans columns.

This page is the reference for the language. It covers [how an expression is evaluated](#evaluation), [truth and null](#truth-and-null), the [types](#types) values carry and the [shapes](#shapes) they come in, how [columns are referred to](#column-references), the [literals](#literals), [operators](#operators), and [functions](#functions) available, [`COLUMNS(...)`](#selecting-multiple-columns) for applying one predicate to many columns, the [type rules](#type-checking) a validator enforces, and the [grammar](#grammar).

An expression can also be *written* in another language — R or Python — by tagging it with [`language`](validate.md#expression-languages). That changes the spelling, not the language: such an expression is read into the one described here, and every rule on this page then applies to it unchanged. This page is the meaning; the tag only says how to get there.

## Evaluation

**One table, at two grains.** An expression sees the columns of one table. A bare column reference is read one row at a time, and evaluating the expression against every row in turn is the whole of its meaning; an [aggregate](#aggregate-functions) instead folds a column over every row at once, giving one value for the table. Which grain each part of an expression has is settled before any data is read — see [shapes](#shapes).

**Deterministic, apart from `NOW()`.** The same row always gives the same result. `NOW()` is the one exception: it reads the current time, so a freshness check like `observed_at >= NOW() - interval(2, weeks)` can pass one day and fail the next even though the data hasn't changed.

**Case sensitivity.** Keywords and function names are case-insensitive, as in SQL — `AND`, `and`, `LENGTH`, and `length` are all accepted. Column names are the exception: unlike SQL's unquoted identifiers, they are case-sensitive, matched exactly against the column names in the data (which may themselves differ only by case), consistent with how `name` is matched everywhere else. Value comparisons (`=`, `LIKE`, `SIMILAR TO`, …) are case-sensitive too.

## Truth and null

Expressions use SQL's three-valued logic, so for a given row an expression is `true`, `false`, or `null` (unknown). A comparison involving a null operand is `null`, not `false` — `LENGTH(postcode) <= 10` is `null` when `postcode` is null.

An expression used as an assertion follows SQL's `CHECK` semantics: the row **passes** when the expression is `true` **or** `null`, and only a `false` result is a violation. An assertion therefore never doubles as a null check. `LENGTH(postcode) <= 10` constrains the values that *are* present but says nothing about missing ones; pair it with the `required` constraint (or an explicit `IS NOT NULL`) when the column must also be non-null.

Because an assertion states what must be **true**, conditional rules are written as implications: "if `q3` then `q4`" becomes `NOT(q3) OR q4 IS NOT NULL`, or equivalently `NOT(q3 AND q4 IS NULL)`.

## Types

Every expression has a type. These are the language's own types, close to but not identical with the column [types](spec.md#types) in the dictionary:

| Type | Where it comes from |
|------|---------------------|
| `number` | A `number` column (any measure), a numeric literal, arithmetic, or a numeric function. |
| `string` | A `string` column, an `enum` column, or a quoted literal. |
| `boolean` | A `boolean` column, `TRUE`/`FALSE`, or any comparison or logical operator. |
| `date` | A `date` column. |
| `datetime` | A `datetime` column, `NOW()`, or a date or datetime plus or minus an interval. |
| `interval` | `interval(<n>, <unit>)`. A duration; it only exists inside an expression, never as a column type. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[15,85]"}

An **`enum`** is a `string`, because [its values are always strings](spec.md#representative-values). It behaves like any other string column: `sex` declared as `values: [M, F, U]` can be measured with `LENGTH` and matched with `LIKE`. The *look* of the values doesn't change that — `values: [2024-01-01, 2024-01-02]` is still a `string`, not a `date`, so it can't be compared with `NOW()`, and `values: [1, 2, 3]` can't be compared with `<`.

A **`struct`** or **`list`** column carries no scalar value of its own, so its bare name may stand only where no type is needed: `address IS NOT NULL` and `COUNT(address)` are fine, and any other use is ill-typed. A `struct`'s fields are reached with [dot access](#field-access), and a field reference has the field's declared type.

A column listed by **name only**, with no `type`, has an unknown type. Using one where a type is needed is an error: nothing can be checked about such an expression, and the fix is something the dictionary wants anyway — declare the column's `type`.

An unknown type is only a problem where a type is actually needed. `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, and [`COUNT`](#count) ask nothing of their operand, so `u IS NOT NULL` — and `COLUMNS(*) IS NOT NULL` on a table with undocumented columns — is fine; `LENGTH(u)` and `u > 5` are not.

`NULL` is the one genuinely typeless thing in the language, and stays compatible with every type.

The `number` measures (`number(id)`, `number(ordinal)`, `number(quantity)`) and a `datetime`'s `time_zone` do not affect type checking: all three measures are just `number`, and a `datetime` is a `datetime` whatever zone it declares.

### Integers and floats {#integers-and-floats}

There is one `number` type, and no expression is ever ill-typed for mixing whole numbers with fractional ones. Underneath, though, a number is held as an **integer** or as a **float**, and a float can also be an infinity or a NaN. Which it is decides how exact the arithmetic is, what `7 / 0` means, and how a comparison answers. [Floating point](floating-point.md) is the reference for all of it.

### Type classes {#type-classes}

Some signatures are written over a *class* of types rather than one type:

| Class     | Members                                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ordered` | `number`, `string`, `date`, `datetime` — the types `<` compares. |
| `Numeric` | `number`.                                                        |

: {tbl-colwidths="[15,85]"}

A class also names a type variable, so `Ordered T → T` reads "takes any ordered type, and returns that same type": `MIN` of a `date` column is a `date`. Only the [aggregates](#aggregate-functions) have signatures of this shape; every other function names its types outright.

## Shapes

Alongside its type, every expression has a **shape**: how many values it stands for.

| Shape   | Comes from                                             | Cardinality          |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `const` | A literal, `NOW()`, or `interval(...)`.                | One value, period.   |
| `row`   | A column reference, a field access, or `COLUMNS(...)`. | One value per row.   |
| `agg`   | An [aggregate function](#aggregate-functions).         | One value per table. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[12,53,35]"}

Two rules fix the shape of everything else.

**An aggregate takes a `row` or `const` argument and returns `agg`.** So aggregates can't nest: `AVG(MIN(x))` asks for the average of a single value, and is a shape error.

**Every other operator and function takes the largest shape among its operands**, ordering them `const` < `agg` < `row`. So `LENGTH(postcode)` is `row`, `MAX(qty) * 2` is `agg`, and `qty <= MAX(qty)` is `row`.

That last one mixes grains, which SQL rejects — there you must write `MAX(qty) OVER ()` — but data-dict allows. There is no `GROUP BY` here for it to be ambiguous with, "no value is more than twice the smallest" is a natural rule to want to state, and it costs one extra pass over the column.

An assertion's own shape decides what a violation can say. A `row` assertion is checked row by row, so a report can point at the row that broke it; an `agg` assertion is a single verdict about the whole table, so a report can only name the table.

## Column references

A name in an expression refers to a column of the table. Written bare, it must be a plain identifier: a letter or `_`, followed by letters, digits, or `_`.

A name of any other shape — one containing a space or punctuation, one starting with a digit, or one that collides with a [reserved word](#grammar) — is written between backticks:

```yaml
constraints:
  - assert: '`creation date` <= NOW()'
  - assert: LENGTH(`postal code`) <= 10
```

The first expression is quoted in YAML and the second isn't, because a backtick is reserved as the first character of a plain YAML scalar. Only that position is affected: an expression that merely contains a backtick needs no YAML quotes.

A backtick-quoted name may contain any character; double a backtick to include one, so ``` `a``b` ``` refers to the column named ``a`b``. An empty or unterminated quoted name is a syntax error.

Quoting changes how a name is *read*, never how it is *matched*: `` `postcode` `` and `postcode` are the same column, and both are matched exactly against the column names in the data, [case included](#evaluation). Quote whenever you like — a name that doesn't need backticks is free to have them.

### Struct fields {#field-access}

A field of a [`struct`](spec.md#struct-fields) column is reached with a dot: `address.zip` is the `zip` field of the `address` column. Dots chain through nested structs (`customer.address.zip`), and each segment is a name in its own right, backtick-quoted independently when its shape requires it (`` `shipping address`.zip ``).

A field reference behaves exactly like a column of the field's declared type: `LENGTH(address.zip) <= 10` type-checks against `zip`'s type, and a field with no declared `type` has an unknown type like any name-only column. When the struct itself is null, every field access on it is null — so, as always, an assertion on a field says nothing about rows where the struct is missing.

Dot access needs a `struct` to its left. A `list` cannot be reached into — `list(struct)` holds many structs per row, and a per-row expression has no way to speak about each element — so a field access through a `list`, or on any non-`struct` operand, is ill-typed, and a field name not declared on its struct is reported like an unknown column. A `COLUMNS(...)` selection is over the table's columns only; a field path can't appear in its list.

The same rules apply to a qualified name in a relationship's [`join`](spec.md#relationships), where each side of the `.` is quoted on its own — `` `other studies`.`creation date` ``, `` food.`category id` ``. A `.` between backticks is part of the name rather than a separator.

## Literals

| Form | Type | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| Integer or decimal | `number` | `42`, `3.14`. A leading `-` is unary minus, not part of the literal. |
| `INF` / `NAN` | `number` | The [non-finite](floating-point.md#non-finite) floats. `-INF` is unary minus applied to `INF`. |
| Single-quoted text | `string` | `'ABC'`, `'O''Brien'` — double a quote to include one. |
| `TRUE` / `FALSE` | `boolean` | |
| `NULL` | none | Compatible with every type. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[25,15,60]"}

There is no dedicated date or datetime literal. Write a date or datetime as a single-quoted ISO 8601 string and compare it against a `date`/`datetime` column — `birthdate >= '2000-01-01'`, `observed_at < '2024-01-31T09:30:00Z'`. Such a literal is a plain string until it meets a temporal column; see [comparisons](#comparability). To *compute* a datetime rather than write one down, use `NOW()` and `interval(...)`.

## Operators

Below, `T` stands for any type, and a signature like `number → number` reads "takes a number, returns a number". Operators are **null-propagating**: if any operand is null the result is null. Three groups are exempt, and they're the ones that make three-valued logic usable:

* `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` inspect nullness, so they always return `true` or `false`.
* `AND` and `OR` short-circuit on a decisive operand: `false AND NULL` is `false`, and `true OR NULL` is `true`.
* `CASE` returns whichever branch its conditions select, null or not.

### Arithmetic

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `-x` | `number → number` | Unary minus. |
| `x + y`, `x - y` | `number, number → number` | |
| `x * y`, `x / y` | `number, number → number` | `/` always gives a [float](#integers-and-floats). A zero divisor gives [an infinity or a NaN](floating-point.md#non-finite), not an error. |
| `d + i`, `i + d`, `d - i` | `date, interval → datetime` | Shifts a date by a duration. |
| `t + i`, `i + t`, `t - i` | `datetime, interval → datetime` | Shifts a datetime by a duration. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20,32,48]"}

Interval arithmetic is the only non-numeric arithmetic. Subtracting one date from another is not supported, nor is multiplying an interval.

Shifting a **date** gives a `datetime`, not a date. An interval can be shorter than a day and a date has no time of day to absorb it, so `birthdate + interval(12, hours)` means midday rather than silently rounding back to the same date. The date is read as midnight, and every unit is allowed. This follows DuckDB and PostgreSQL, which both hand back a timestamp. The result stays [comparable](#comparability) with a `date`, so `d + interval(2, days) >= start_date` is well-typed.

### Comparison

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `x = y` | `T, T → boolean` | |
| `x != y`, `x <> y` | `T, T → boolean` | The two spellings are identical. |
| `x < y`, `x <= y`, `x > y`, `x >= y` | `T, T → boolean` | `T` must be an [`Ordered`](#type-classes) type. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[28,25,47]"}

Both sides must be [comparable](#comparability). String comparison is by code point, and so case-sensitive. A [NaN](floating-point.md#comparison) is unordered, so every comparison against one is `false` except `<>`, which is `true`.

### Null tests

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `x IS NULL` | `T → boolean` | |
| `x IS NOT NULL` | `T → boolean` | |

: {tbl-colwidths="[25,22,53]"}

### Logic

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `NOT x` | `boolean → boolean` | `NOT NULL` is null. |
| `x AND y` | `boolean, boolean → boolean` | Null unless one side is `false`, which makes the whole thing `false`. |
| `x OR y` | `boolean, boolean → boolean` | Null unless one side is `true`, which makes the whole thing `true`. |
| `( … )` | grouping | |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20,30,50]"}

### Membership

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `x BETWEEN lo AND hi` | `T, T, T → boolean` | Inclusive on both ends, and null if any of the three operands is null. A [NaN](floating-point.md#comparison) subject is `false`. |
| `x NOT BETWEEN lo AND hi` | `T, T, T → boolean` | |
| `x IN (a, b, …)` | `T, T… → boolean` | Each list item must be comparable with `x`. |
| `x NOT IN (a, b, …)` | `T, T… → boolean` | Null if `x` is null or `x` matches nothing but the list contains a null. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,25,45]"}

### Pattern matching

| Operator | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `s LIKE p` | `string, string → boolean` | `%` matches any run of characters, `_` any single character. |
| `s NOT LIKE p` | `string, string → boolean` | |
| `s SIMILAR TO p` | `string, string → boolean` | `p` is a regular expression. |
| `s NOT SIMILAR TO p` | `string, string → boolean` | |

: {tbl-colwidths="[28,27,45]"}

A `SIMILAR TO` pattern is an [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regular expression, anchored so it must match the whole string (as in DuckDB, and unlike PostgreSQL's `SIMILAR TO`, it does not use `%`/`_` wildcards). Both operators are case-sensitive; use `LOWER` on the subject, or an inline `(?i)` flag in a `SIMILAR TO` pattern, for a case-insensitive match.

### Conditional

`CASE WHEN c1 THEN r1 [WHEN c2 THEN r2 …] [ELSE r] END` takes one or more `boolean` conditions, and returns the result of the first whose condition is `true`. If none is, it returns the `ELSE` result, or null when there is no `ELSE`. The `WHEN` conditions must be boolean; the results may be any type, but keep them all the same type so the `CASE` itself has one (see [type checking](#type-checking)).

```yaml
- assert: CASE WHEN kind = 'weight' THEN value < 1000 ELSE value < 10 END
```

Only the searched form (`CASE WHEN <condition>`) is supported, not the simple form (`CASE <expr> WHEN <value>`). An implication written with `NOT`/`OR` is usually shorter and clearer than the equivalent `CASE`.

### Precedence

From tightest to loosest, following standard SQL:

1. `( )`, function calls, `CASE`
2. unary `-`
3. `*`, `/`
4. `+`, `-`
5. comparisons, `IS NULL`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `SIMILAR TO`
6. `NOT`
7. `AND`
8. `OR`

Binary operators of equal precedence associate left to right. Comparisons don't chain, though — `lo < x < hi` is a syntax error; write `x BETWEEN lo AND hi`, or `x > lo AND x < hi` if you want the bounds exclusive.

Use parentheses when in doubt: `NOT(q3) OR q4 IS NOT NULL` and `NOT (q3 OR q4 IS NOT NULL)` are different rules.

## Functions

Function names are case-insensitive. Every scalar function is null-propagating: any null argument gives a null result. The [aggregates](#aggregate-functions) are the exception — they ignore null inputs rather than propagating them. Passing the wrong number of arguments, or an argument of the wrong type, is an error at spec-validation time, not something that happens per row.

### String functions

#### `LENGTH(s)`

`string → number`. The number of characters (Unicode code points) in `s`, not the number of bytes.

```yaml
- assert: LENGTH(postcode) <= 10
```

#### `LOWER(s)`, `UPPER(s)`

`string → string`. `s` with each character mapped to lower or upper case. Useful for making a comparison case-insensitive:

```yaml
- assert: LOWER(country) IN ('nz', 'au')
```

#### `TRIM(s)`

`string → string`. `s` with leading and trailing whitespace removed. Only the one-argument form is supported — there's no custom trim set, and no separate `LTRIM`/`RTRIM`.

```yaml
- assert: TRIM(name) = name
  description: Names are stored without surrounding whitespace.
```

#### `STARTS_WITH(s, prefix)`, `ENDS_WITH(s, suffix)`

`string, string → boolean`. Whether `s` begins or ends with the given substring. Both arguments are strings and the match is case-sensitive and literal — no wildcards. For a pattern, use `LIKE` or `SIMILAR TO` instead.

```yaml
- assert: STARTS_WITH(sku, 'NZ-')
```

### Numeric functions

#### `ABS(x)`

`number → number`. The absolute value of `x`.

#### `FLOOR(x)`, `CEIL(x)`

`number → number`. `x` rounded down (towards negative infinity) or up (towards positive infinity) to a whole number.

#### `ROUND(x)`, `ROUND(x, digits)` {#round}

`number → number` or `number, number → number`. `x` rounded to `digits` decimal places, or to a whole number when `digits` is omitted. Halves round away from zero, so `ROUND(0.5)` is `1` and `ROUND(-0.5)` is `-1`. A negative `digits` rounds to the left of the decimal point (`ROUND(1234, -2)` is `1200`). This is the only function whose arity varies.

```yaml
- assert: ROUND(share, 2) = share
  description: Shares are recorded to two decimal places.
```

#### `MOD(x, y)` {#mod}

`number, number → number`. The remainder of `x / y`, taking its sign from `y` (so `MOD(-7, 3)` is `2` and `MOD(7, -3)` is `-2`). This is the convention R and Python use; C and SQL take the sign from `x` instead. A zero `y` gives [a NaN](floating-point.md#non-finite), as `0 / 0` does — the one place `MOD` over two integers does not give an integer, since a NaN is a float.

```yaml
- assert: MOD(minutes, 15) = 0
  description: Appointments start on a quarter hour.
```

#### `IS_FINITE(x)`, `IS_INFINITE(x)`, `IS_NAN(x)` {#non-finite-predicates}

`number → boolean`. Which kind of number `x` is: an ordinary one, an infinity, or a NaN. See [infinity and NaN](floating-point.md#non-finite) for what each answers and why `IS NULL` is not among them.

```yaml
- assert: IS_FINITE(total / qty)
  description: No order has a zero quantity.
```

### Date and time functions

#### `NOW()` {#now}

`→ datetime`. The current time, as an instant. Takes no arguments, and is the one non-deterministic thing in the language: an expression that uses it depends on when it runs. Its value is fixed for the whole evaluation, so two `NOW()`s in one expression always agree.

#### `interval(n, unit)`

`number, unit → interval`. A duration of `n` units, for use with `+` or `-` on a `date` or `datetime`. `n` is a number and `unit` is a bare keyword (not a string), one of:

| Unit | Length |
|------|--------|
| `seconds` | 1 second |
| `minutes` | 60 seconds |
| `hours` | 60 minutes |
| `days` | 24 hours |
| `weeks` | 7 days |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

All five are fixed-length. Calendar units (`months`, `years`) are deliberately excluded: they're non-uniform (adding a month lands on a different number of days depending on the date, and clamps at month ends), which would make an expression's meaning depend on the calendar. Express a rough month as `interval(30, days)` if you need it.

All five may be added to a `date` as well as a `datetime`; [shifting a date](#arithmetic) gives a datetime either way.

```yaml
- assert: observed_at >= NOW() - interval(2, weeks)
  description: The export always covers the last fortnight.
```

### Aggregate functions

An aggregate folds a column over every row of the table into a single value, so its [shape](#shapes) is `agg`. Unlike every other function, an aggregate **ignores** nulls rather than propagating them, and each one says separately what it gives back when there is nothing left to fold; see [empty and all-null input](#empty-input).

Their signatures are written over the [type classes](#type-classes).

#### `MIN(x)`, `MAX(x)`

`Ordered T → T`. The smallest and largest non-null value of `x`, in that type's own order — so `MIN` of a `date` column is the earliest date, and of a `string` column the first by code point.

```yaml
- assert: value <= 2 * MIN(value)
  description: No reading is more than twice the smallest.
```

Note the mixed grain: `value` is one value per row and `MIN(value)` one per table, which [is allowed](#shapes).

#### `SUM(x)`

`Numeric → number`. The total of the non-null values. A sum of integers is an integer.

#### `AVG(x)`

`Numeric → number`. The mean of the non-null values. Always a float, even over integers.

```yaml
- assert: AVG(score) BETWEEN 0 AND 100
```

#### `COUNT(x)` {#count}

`T → number`, for any `T` at all. How many rows have a non-null `x`.

`COUNT` is the one function that does not constrain its argument. Like `IS NULL`, it asks only whether each value is null, so it never consults `x`'s type: a `struct`, a `list`, and a [column listed by name only](#types) are all fair game, and `COUNT(address)` counts the rows that have an address. (A null `list` is missing; an empty one is present, as [everywhere else](spec.md#column-constraints).)

`COUNT(x) = ROW_COUNT()` says "`x` is never null", which the [`required` constraint](spec.md#column-constraints) already says more directly — prefer `required`. `COUNT` earns its place on the *partial* case, which nothing else in the language can state:

```yaml
- assert: COUNT(email) >= 0.9 * ROW_COUNT()
  description: At least 90% of customers have an email address.
```

#### `ROW_COUNT()`

`→ number`. How many rows the table has, nulls included. It takes no arguments, which is why there is no `COUNT(*)` form.

#### `COUNT_DISTINCT(x)`

`Ordered T → number`. How many distinct non-null values `x` takes.

```yaml
- assert: COUNT_DISTINCT(region) <= 16
```

A function rather than a `DISTINCT` modifier.

#### `ANY(b)`, `ALL(b)`

`boolean → boolean`. Whether any, or every, non-null row is true.

A bare `b` already asserts that `b` holds for every row, so `ALL(b)` is rarely worth writing as a whole assertion. Both earn their place inside a larger rule, where the aggregate's single value is compared or combined with something else.

These are not SQL's `ANY` and `ALL`. There those names are quantifiers over a subquery — `x > ALL (SELECT ...)` — and the boolean aggregates are spelled `BOOL_OR` and `BOOL_AND` instead, precisely to avoid the ambiguity.

#### Empty and all-null input {#empty-input}

Aggregates skip nulls — and only nulls, so a [NaN or an infinity](floating-point.md#identity) is folded in like any other value. A column holding nothing but nulls behaves exactly like a table with no rows, and every aggregate gives the same answer either way:

* `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `ANY` and `ALL` return null.
* `COUNT` and `COUNT_DISTINCT` return 0.
* `ROW_COUNT` returns the number of rows, which is 0 when there are none; it never looks at values, so all-null rows still count.

Combined with [`CHECK` semantics](#truth-and-null), where a null result passes, this means an aggregate assertion **passes vacuously on an empty table**: `AVG(score) BETWEEN 0 AND 100` holds when there are no scores.

Returning null follows SQL, where folding nothing yields unknown. Dataframe libraries take the other route and return the fold's identity element: R, polars and pandas all give `0` for `SUM`, `false` for `ANY`, and `true` for `ALL`. (R also returns `Inf`/`-Inf` with a warning for `MIN`/`MAX`, where polars and pandas agree with SQL and give null.) In an assertion the difference rarely shows, since null passes and `ALL(b)` holds vacuously either way, but a rule like `SUM(qty) > 0` passes here on an empty table where an R user would expect a violation.

## Selecting multiple columns

To apply the same predicate to a group of columns without repeating it, use a `COLUMNS(...)` expression — a simple subset of [DuckDB's `COLUMNS`](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/sql/expressions/star). The supported forms select columns by:

| Form | Selects |
|------|---------|
| `COLUMNS(*)` | Every column in the table. |
| `COLUMNS('<regex>')` | Every column whose name matches the regular expression. |
| `COLUMNS([a, b, c])` | An explicit list of column names. |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}

Names in the list are [written like any other column reference](#column-references), backticks included where they're needed: ``COLUMNS([`creation date`, updated_at])``. The regex form matches against the plain name, without them.

The regex is an [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) expression matched **unanchored** (a partial match, as in DuckDB), so `COLUMNS('q')` selects every column whose name contains a `q`; anchor it with `^`/`$` to match the whole name. This is the one place a regex is unanchored — `SIMILAR TO` anchors.

A `COLUMNS(...)` node stands in for a column reference, and the expression around it is evaluated once per selected column. The result is true only when it is true for **every** selected column — the per-column results are combined with `AND`.

```yaml
constraints:
  # Every q4–q8 answer is present whenever q3 is true.
  - assert: NOT(q3) OR COLUMNS('q[4-8]') IS NOT NULL
    description: q4–q8 must be answered when q3 is true.
  # No column anywhere in the table is null.
  - assert: COLUMNS(*) IS NOT NULL
```

Three rules bound the feature:

* **At most one `COLUMNS(...)`** may appear in an expression, so there's no ambiguity about how two selections would combine. A selection inside a referenced [definition](spec.md#definitions) counts toward the expression that references it, so an assertion can't pair its own `COLUMNS(...)` with a filter definition's.
* **Every selected column must fit the way the expression uses it**, since the predicate is applied to each in turn. `LENGTH(COLUMNS('name_.*'))` requires that each matched column is a string, just as a bare column reference would.
* **A regex that matches nothing is a warning.** It's almost always a typo, and the expression would otherwise hold vacuously. `COLUMNS(*)` and an explicit list can't trigger it — an empty list isn't expressible, and an unknown name in a list is an error rather than a warning.

The lambda form (`COLUMNS(c -> ...)`) and the star modifiers (`EXCLUDE`, `REPLACE`, `RENAME`) are **not** supported.

## Type checking

Expressions are checked when the dictionary is validated, against the columns of the enclosing table alone — before any data is read. A malformed expression, an unknown column, an ill-typed expression, an empty column selection, and a nested aggregate are each reported separately; see [validation](dev-validation.md) for the codes and severities.

Five rules decide whether an expression is well formed, and a sixth — that [every operand whose type matters has one](#types) — applies throughout. The more the dictionary says about a column, the more of an expression can be checked.

### Constraint expressions as a whole must be boolean

A constraint states a rule, so its result must be a truth value. A bare non-boolean column is not a rule on its own; compare or test it (`qty > 0`, `postcode IS NOT NULL`). A bare top-level `COLUMNS(...)` is fine so long as every column it selects is boolean.

### Operands must match their operator or function

The signatures above are enforced exactly: `LENGTH(qty)` on a numeric column is an error, as is `LENGTH('a', 'b')`, as is calling a function that doesn't exist. A signature written over a [class](#type-classes) is enforced the same way — `SUM(name)` on a string column is an error, because `string` is not `Numeric`.

### Compared values must be comparable {#comparability}

Two operands may be compared when any of the following holds:

* They have the same type.
* Both are temporal — a `date` may be compared with a `datetime`, so `some_date < NOW()` is fine.
* One is a string literal whose text parses as the other side's type, which is how `birthdate >= '2000-01-01'` works. This applies to literals only; a `string` *column* can't be compared with a `date` column.
* One is `NULL`, which is compatible with everything.

### A `CASE` must have one result type

Its type is the common type of its branches; branches of differing types make the whole `CASE` typeless, which then passes any comparison it's used in. That's permitted but rarely what you want.

### An aggregate can't contain another aggregate

The one rule about [shape](#shapes) rather than type. An aggregate needs a value per row to fold, and another aggregate hands it a single value, so `AVG(MIN(x))` is a shape error. It is the analogue of SQL's "column must appear in the `GROUP BY` clause" and, like the type rules, it fires before any data is read.

Every other combination of shapes is well formed, [mixed grains included](#shapes).

## Grammar

For reference, the full grammar, loosest to tightest:

```text
expr           := or_expr
or_expr        := and_expr ("OR" and_expr)*
and_expr       := not_expr ("AND" not_expr)*
not_expr       := "NOT" not_expr | predicate
predicate      := additive ( cmp additive
                           | "IS" ["NOT"] "NULL"
                           | ["NOT"] "BETWEEN" additive "AND" additive
                           | ["NOT"] "IN" "(" expr ("," expr)* ")"
                           | ["NOT"] "LIKE" additive
                           | ["NOT"] "SIMILAR" "TO" additive )?
additive       := multiplicative (("+" | "-") multiplicative)*
multiplicative := unary (("*" | "/") unary)*
unary          := "-" unary | primary
primary        := literal | column | funcall | columns | case | "(" expr ")"
cmp            := "=" | "!=" | "<>" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
literal        := number | string | "TRUE" | "FALSE" | "NULL" | "INF" | "NAN"
funcall        := IDENT "(" (expr ("," expr)*)? ")"   // incl. NOW(), interval(n, unit)
columns        := "COLUMNS" "(" ("*" | string | "[" name ("," name)* "]") ")"
case           := "CASE" ("WHEN" expr "THEN" expr)+ ("ELSE" expr)? "END"
column         := name ("." name)*
name           := IDENT | QUOTED
IDENT          := [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
QUOTED         := "`" ( [^`] | "``" )+ "`"
```

A function name is always an `IDENT`; only columns can be quoted.

The aggregates need no grammar of their own: each is an ordinary `funcall`, and `ROW_COUNT()` is the empty-argument case the rule already admits. None of their names is reserved either, so a column called `count` or `min` remains reachable without backticks — a name followed by `(` is a call, and anything else is a column.

The following words are reserved and can't be used as a bare column name: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IS`, `NULL`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `SIMILAR`, `TO`, `WHEN`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `END`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `INF`, `NAN`, `CASE`, `COLUMNS`, `NOW`, `INTERVAL`. A column named after one of them is still reachable [in backticks](#column-references), and the name stays available after a `.`, so a struct field called `inf` needs no quoting.

`INF` and `NAN` are on that list because they are [literals](#literals), so a column named `inf` or `nan` — not far-fetched in scientific data — needs its backticks. An assertion that names one bare compares against the literal instead, which is a change of meaning rather than a parse error, so it is worth checking for.
