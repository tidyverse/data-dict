title: "Installing the CLI"
---

The `data-dict` command line tool validates a `data-dict.yaml` file against the
[specification](spec.md), against a dataset's metadata, and against the data
itself; it can also draft, render, export, and translate dictionaries. See
[validation](validation.md) for what each level checks.

Every release ships prebuilt binaries, so you don't need a Rust toolchain to
install it.

## Install script

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tidyverse/data-dict/releases/latest/download/data-dict-cli-installer.sh | sh
```

On Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/tidyverse/data-dict/releases/latest/download/data-dict-cli-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

The script downloads the binary for your platform, verifies its checksum, and
puts `data-dict` in `~/.cargo/bin` (`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows),
adding that directory to your `PATH` if it isn't already there. Set
`DATA_DICT_CLI_INSTALL_DIR` to install somewhere else, and
`DATA_DICT_CLI_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` to leave your `PATH` alone.

To install a specific version, replace `latest/download` with
`download/v0.0.1` (or whichever tag you want).

Check that it worked:

```bash
data-dict --version
```

## Download a binary

If you'd rather not pipe a script into a shell, grab the archive for your
platform from the [releases
page](https://github.com/tidyverse/data-dict/releases/latest), unpack it, and
move the `data-dict` binary onto your `PATH`. Each archive has a matching
`.sha256` file, and every release has a combined `sha256.sum`.

The binaries aren't code-signed, so macOS quarantines archives downloaded
through a browser. If Gatekeeper refuses to run `data-dict`, clear the flag with
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine data-dict`, or use the install script above,
which isn't affected.

Prebuilt binaries are available for:

| Platform | Target |
|----------|--------|
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS (Intel) | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Linux (x86-64) | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Windows (x86-64) | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |

The Linux binaries are statically linked against musl, so they have no libc
dependency and run on any distribution, glibc or musl.

## From R

The `datadict` R package (in `r/` in the repository) installs the binary into
R's user cache directory and calls it for you:

```r
pak::pak("tidyverse/data-dict/r")
datadict::dd_install()
datadict::dd_validate_data("path/to/project")
```

`dd_install()` downloads the release archive for your platform, checks it
against the published `.sha256`, and unpacks `data-dict` into
`tools::R_user_dir("datadict", "cache")`. `dd_validate_data()` runs
`validate-data`, writes the HTML report, and opens it in your browser.

## Build from source

On any other platform, build it yourself with
[Cargo](https://rustup.rs):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/tidyverse/data-dict data-dict-cli
```

The prebuilt binaries bundle the `data-dict.yaml` language server, which the
editor integrations use. A source install leaves it out unless you ask for it:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/tidyverse/data-dict data-dict-cli --features lsp
```

## Uninstall

Delete the binary:

```bash
rm ~/.cargo/bin/data-dict
```

The install script also leaves a receipt in
`~/.config/data-dict-cli/data-dict-cli-receipt.json` recording what it
installed and where; you can delete that too.
