# Report

A **report** is one validation run's findings as JSON, so a program can act on them. Every check in [validation.md](dev-validation.md) (`S##`, `M##`, or `D##`) reports through this one document, and only those checks do. The `data-dict` CLI writes one for any validation run it can get started: `validate-spec`, `validate-meta` and `validate-data` all write it with `--json`, and `render-report` runs `validate-data` and writes the same report as a self-contained page for a person to read.

A report is a superset of the diagnostics rendered for a person: every position a diagnostic highlights is in it, and it names more offending rows.

The [level](dev-validation.md#three-levels-of-validation) validated determines which checks ran, not the shape of what they report: a data-level report carries `S##` and `M##` problems too, since each level implies the ones before it. `D##` problems do carry something the earlier levels have no use for: found by reading the data, they name the offending rows, not just the table and column the dictionary declares. If an earlier level finds an error, the run stops there and reports only what it got to. A run that finds nothing still produces a report, with an empty `problems` list.

A failure that stops the run before any check can be applied is not a finding about the data dictionary and has no code, so it is not reported this way at all: the file can't be read or isn't YAML, a Parquet file fails mid-read, or the table asked for isn't in the dictionary. The CLI reports such a failure as a plain error and writes no report. Every problem in a report therefore carries a `code`.

## Output shape

A key with nothing to say is **omitted** rather than serialized as `null` or `[]`: keys marked `?` below may be absent, meaning the value doesn't apply to this problem or step. Zeroes and falses are real data and always appear. Consumers should read absent and null interchangeably. The rule is about a problem's and a step's own keys, plus the optional `failed_rows`; the other five top-level keys are always present, `steps` and `problems` as empty lists when there is nothing to list.

The problems are one flat list. They are deliberately not also grouped by check, by table, or by row: everything needed to build those views is on each problem, and a consumer that wants them can group the list itself rather than reconcile several copies of the same finding.

### Top level

```jsonc
{
  "$version": "0.1.0",           // version of the report document format itself
  "run": Run,                    // what was validated, and by what
  "status": "ok" | "warning" | "error",
  "steps": [ Step ],
  "problems": [ Problem ],
  "failed_rows?": [ FailedRows ]
}
```

`run` is what the run was: which dictionary, at which level, when, and by what.

`status` is the worst severity present: `error` if any problem is an error, `warning` if there are only warnings, `ok` if there are none.

`steps` is what the run checked, `problems` is what it found. A step is one check applied to one target: a column, a set of key columns, an assertion, or a table. Every step the run reached is listed whether it passed or failed, so a consumer can report a pass rate and not just a failure list.

Which steps exist follows from the dictionary: a `required` column gets a `D01` step, a `unique` one a `D02` step, each `assert` a `D07` step, and a column with no constraint gets none. A struct's fields are declared columns too, so a field gets the steps its own declaration implies (`M01`, and `D04` when it is an `enum`), named by its dotted path. A spec check (`S##`) reads the document as a whole rather than one declared target, so it is reported through `problems` alone, and `steps` is empty for a spec-level run. A run over a single table lists that table's steps alone.

Every step the level attempted is listed, including the ones it could not weigh. A step is missing only when its level never ran at all: a spec error stops the run, so the metadata and data steps that would have followed are absent rather than listed unevaluated. The level also decides which steps exist at all: a metadata run lists its `M##` steps alone, since the `D##` checks never ran.

The problems are in no promised order beyond this: a spec problem sits at its position in the document, and a metadata or data problem in the order the run found it. A consumer that wants another order sorts the list itself.

`failed_rows` gathers the failing rows themselves, one entry per table, for a consumer that wants to show the records rather than the findings. Only a data-level run that found row-naming failures carries it.

```jsonc
{
  "table": "otters",
  "count": 264,                       // distinct failing rows, never capped
  "rows": [57, 812, 4310],            // the first so many, ascending
  "keys?": [{"id": "otter-41"}, ...], // the primary key each listed row held
  "values": [{"status": "retired", ...}, ...], // every other declared column
  "redacted": false
}
```

`rows` is the union of the row numbers the table's problems named — one row listed once, however many checks it failed — ascending and capped like a problem's `rows`, with `count` the total before capping. `values` holds **every declared column** present in the data, not just the ones a check is about, keyed by column name and lined up with `rows`; `keys` splits out the primary key's columns, absent when the table declares none. A nested column, whose value no single cell can name, is left out. Withholding follows [restricted columns](#restricted-columns): a restricted column appears in neither `keys` nor `values`, and its presence anywhere in the table sets `redacted`.

### Run

```jsonc
{
  "dictionary": "data-dict.yaml",           // the file the run validated
  "level": "spec" | "meta" | "data",        // the level that ran
  "table?": "otters",                       // the one table the run covered
  "generated_at": "2026-08-14T09:31:02Z",   // when the run finished, UTC
  "tool": { "name": "data-dict",            // what produced the report
            "version?": "0.4.2" }
}
```

`dictionary` is the file the run read, as the producer resolved it: a relative path stays relative rather than being made absolute, so an archived report doesn't record where the machine that made it kept its files. It names the file every [`Location`](#location) in the report is a span of. It is not a promise that the file is still there, or that it can be found from wherever the report ends up.

`level` is the [level](dev-validation.md#three-levels-of-validation) that ran, and so what decides which checks the report could carry. It can't be inferred from the findings: a data-level run that found nothing in the data reports what a spec-level run reports.

`table` is present only for a run over a single table, and names it; a whole-dictionary run omits it. This can't be inferred either — a one-table dictionary and a single-table run over a larger one list the same steps.

`generated_at` is when the run finished, in UTC to the second, as an ISO 8601 timestamp with a `Z` offset.

`tool` is what produced the report, so a report found on its own says where it came from. `version` is that producer's own version and is absent for a producer that has none; it is not the version of this format, which is `$version`.

A report carries no copy of the dictionary's text. A consumer that wants to draw the annotated excerpt a diagnostic shows reads the file `dictionary` names and takes the spans from there.

### Problem

```jsonc
{
  "code": "D04",                 // the check's code in dev-validation.md
  "step?": 3,                    // the `id` of the step that found it
  "severity": "error" | "warning",
  "kind": "values_outside_enum", // the finding's shape, see below
  "message": "string",           // what was found, a lowercase fragment
  "expected?": "string",         // what the spec requires, a full sentence
  "hint?": "string",             // advice on how to fix it
  "suggestion?": { "title": "string", "replacement": "string",
                   "location": Location },
  "table?": "string",            // the table the problem is about
  "columns?": ["string"],        // the columns it is about, dotted for a struct field
  "location?": Location,         // the offending node itself
  "context?": [ Location ],      // the nodes enclosing it, outermost first
  ...                            // the keys of this `kind`, see below
}
```

`expected` and `message` are two halves of one sentence: `expected` states the rule in general ("A range's minimum must be less than or equal to its maximum."), `message` reports the specific violation ("minimum `100` is greater than maximum `10`"). A problem always has a `message`; it has an `expected` whenever the rule can be stated in the abstract.

`columns` is every column the problem is about, in dictionary order: one entry for a problem about a single column, several for a composite key or an assertion that reads more than one (`start_date < end_date` names both). It is absent for a problem about no column in particular — a table-level or document-level one. A consumer that groups by column lists such a problem under each of its columns. A `table` and its `columns` are what the check itself was about; a spec problem, which reads the document rather than any declared target, names them only when the check it comes from is about one, and otherwise locates itself through `location` and `context` alone.

A column named by a `columns` entry is written as its dotted path when it is a struct field. A column name may itself contain a dot, so a consumer that must recover the path segments should match against the dictionary rather than splitting the string.

`suggestion` is a concrete edit: splice `replacement` into the source over the suggestion's own `location`, which is an insertion point when it is empty.

`step` is absent for a problem no step accounts for: a spec problem, and an undocumented column (`M03`). A step whose `outcome` is `fail` always has at least one problem pointing back at it.

### Step

```jsonc
{
  "id": 3,                       // 1-based, unique within this report
  "code": "D04",                 // the check's code in dev-validation.md
  "table": "otters",             // the table the step checked
  "columns?": ["site", "day"],   // the columns it checked, dotted for a struct field
  "assertion?": "weight > 0",    // the expression, for an assertion step
  "outcome": "pass" | "fail" | "unevaluated",
  "row_count?": 91043,           // rows of the table the step covered
  "failed_row_count?": 2,        // rows that failed; passed is the difference
  "location?": { … }             // the declaration the step checks, as a problem's `location`
}
```

`columns` follows the same rule as a problem's: every column the step checked, in dictionary order — one for a per-column check, the key's columns for a composite key, and every column the expression reads for an assertion. It is absent for a step about the table as a whole (`M04`), and for an assertion that reads no column at all.

Steps are in dictionary order: tables as `tables` declares them, then the table's own `M04` step, then each table's columns in order — a struct's fields following the column that holds them — and under each column its checks by code, the metadata one before the data ones, as the levels run. A step over several columns sorts by the first of them; one about no column sorts last.

A step's `code` is the code it reports when the thing it checks is plainly wrong. Several checks are alternative verdicts on one declared target — a column is either the wrong type (`M01`) or absent (`M02`), and a uniqueness check either finds duplicates (`D02`) or can't compare the values at all (`D03`) — so one step covers them and the problem carries the code that actually applied:

| Step `code` | One step per | Problem codes it can report |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `M01` | column the dictionary declares | `M01`, `M02` |
| `M04` | table validated against data | `M04`, `M05` |
| `D01` | `required` or `primary_key` column | `D01` |
| `D02` | `unique` column, and the primary key as a whole | `D02`, `D03` |
| `D04` | `enum` column, including a nested one | `D04` |
| `D05` | single-column `foreign_key` | `D05`, `D06` |
| `D07` | `assert` expression | `D07`, `D08`, `D09` |

: {tbl-colwidths="[15,40,45]"}

`M03` is the one check with nothing to declare it: the column exists only in the data, so no step covers it and its problem has no `step`.

One column can be two steps of the same code: a column declared both `unique` and `primary_key` is checked twice for `D02`, once on its own and once as the key. The two steps name the same `columns`, and are told apart by their `id` alone.

`outcome` is the step's verdict, and the only thing a consumer should read it from: `pass` if the step found nothing, `fail` if at least one problem points back at it, `unevaluated` if it could not reach a verdict at all. Do not infer the verdict from the counts below — a step over an empty table fails with nothing to count.

`outcome` is `unevaluated` when the values were not comparable (`D03`, `D06`), the expression could not be run (`D08`, `D09`), or the check never reached the data at all: the table's data could not be read, which leaves every step of that table unevaluated; the column the step is about is missing from the data (`M02`) or sits under a column that is (`M01`, `M02`); or the assertion reads such a column. A step that did not evaluate has not passed, and a consumer must not count it as one. `unevaluated` takes precedence over `fail`: a `D03` or `D08` problem points back at its step and still leaves it unevaluated, since the check reported why it couldn't run rather than a verdict.

`row_count` is how many of the table's rows the step covered and `failed_row_count` how many of them failed, so every step of a table counts in the same unit against the same denominator. A step counts rows even where its problem counts something else: a `D04` step over a `list(enum)` column fails as many rows as held a bad value, while the problem's `count` is how many bad values there were. A check with a single verdict is all or nothing: a metadata step, or an aggregate assertion like `SUM(weight) > 0`, fails every row of the table or none of them. That is a coarse weighting so such a step can be counted alongside the row-level ones, not a claim about which rows are at fault — an aggregate assertion's own problem still blames no individual row.

Both keys are absent when the step has no row count to report: when `outcome` is `unevaluated`, and when the failure is that the table's rows could never be counted in the first place (`M04`, `M05`).

A step carries no values, only counts, so nothing on it is ever withheld for a [restricted](spec.md#display) column.

Nothing is duplicated between the two lists: a step says how much was checked and how much failed, and its problems say what failed and where. A step-by-step report table is `steps` joined to `problems` on `id`, and that join is the consumer's to make, for the same reason `problems` is not also grouped by table or by code.

### Location

A `Location` is a span of the dictionary the run read — the file [`run.dictionary`](#run) names — and never of the data. Even a `D##` problem locates itself in the dictionary, at the place where the dictionary makes the claim the data broke; the data side is reported as row numbers instead.

```jsonc
{ "start_line": 0, "start_column": 2, "end_line": 0, "end_column": 9 }
```

Lines and columns count from 0. A column counts Unicode characters, not bytes and not UTF-16 code units, so a span is measured the way the text reads. Diagnostics rendered for a person show the same positions 1-based.

`location` is the offending node itself, and `context` the nodes enclosing it — for a bad value in a column, the table's name and the column's name. Together they are everything a rendered diagnostic highlights, so a consumer can draw the same annotated excerpt from the document alone. Both are absent for a problem with no place in the file — a metadata problem about a column the dictionary never mentions (`M03`).

### Kinds

`kind` names the shape of the finding, and decides which further keys the problem carries. Each kind maps to one check, except `schema` and `spec`, which cover every structural and every semantic spec check respectively; consult `dev-validation.md` for what a check means.

| `kind` | `code` | Additional keys |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| `schema` | `S60`–`S69` | |
| `spec` | `S01`–`S31` | |
| `type_mismatch` | `M01` | `declared`, `actual` |
| `missing_in_data` | `M02` | |
| `extra_in_data` | `M03` | `actual` |
| `missing_source` | `M04` | |
| `unreadable_source` | `M05` | |
| `nulls_in_required` | `D01` | `count`, `rows`, `keys`, `redacted` |
| `duplicate_values` | `D02` | `count`, `rows`, `keys`, `values`, `redacted` |
| `uniqueness_not_verified` | `D03` | `reason` |
| `values_outside_enum` | `D04` | `count`, `rows`, `keys`, `values`, `redacted` |
| `foreign_key_not_found` | `D05` | `column`, `references`, `count`, `rows`, `keys`, `values`, `redacted` |
| `referential_integrity_not_verified` | `D06` | `column`, `references`, `reason` |
| `assertion_violated` | `D07` | `assertion`, `count`, `rows`, `keys`, `values`, `redacted` |
| `assertion_false` | `D07` | `assertion` |
| `assertion_not_checked` | `D08` | `assertion`, `column`, `reason` |
| `assertion_overflow` | `D09` | `assertion`, `row` |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,10,60]"}

`schema` and `spec` are the two halves of spec validation and are kept apart because a consumer treats them differently: a `schema` problem means the document could not be read as a data dictionary at all, so no `spec` problem could be looked for, while a `spec` problem is a finding about a document that was read successfully.

`column`, singular, is the one column a kind singles out, as against the list in `columns`: `D05` and `D06` put the referencing column there and name the target they compare it against in `references`, and `D08`'s is the one column of the assertion that can't be read as its declared type — absent when the obstacle isn't one column's type. `D02` and `D03` single out no column, and carry the key's columns in `columns` alone.

`values_outside_enum` and `assertion_violated` also arise for a nested column: `columns` then holds the dotted path to the struct field, and its rows are the rows of the top-level column that holds it.

## Counting and capping

Three keys describe how many rows broke a check and which ones:

* `count` is the **exact** total number of offending rows — of offending *values* for a check over a column that holds several per row, like a `list(enum)`. It is never capped.
* `rows` are the offending row numbers, ascending, **capped** at the first so many. Row numbers are 1-based and absolute within the table's Parquet file, so they survive row-group boundaries and can be used to seek back into the data.
* `keys` are the values the table's `primary_key` columns held on each listed row, one **object** per row, keyed by column name — which row failed, not just where it sits. Absent when the table declares no primary key, and a key column the problem's `values` already name — a duplicate primary key reports its own key — is not repeated.
* `values` are the offending values themselves, one **object** per offending row, keyed by column name.

A `values` entry holds just the columns the check is about — the enum column for `D04`, the referencing column for `D05`, the key's columns for `D02`, the columns the expression reads for `D07` — never the whole row; the primary key a row held rides along in `keys` instead. `keys` and `values` entries line up with `rows`: one per row number, in the same order, and nothing is deduplicated, so a value that offends twice appears twice.

```jsonc
"rows": [57, 812, 4310],
"values": [{"status": "retired"}, {"status": "unknown"}, {"status": "retired"}]
```

```jsonc
"rows": [12, 91],
"values": [{"weight": "-1.5", "length": "60"}, {"weight": "0", "length": "74"}]
```

An offending value is always a **string**, and never a JSON number or boolean. Each value renders the way the same value would be written as a `range` bound or an `examples` entry in the dictionary itself: a number in decimal at full precision, a date or datetime as ISO 8601, a boolean as `"true"` or `"false"`, a non-finite float as `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, or `"-Infinity"`.

A value that is *missing* is the one thing that isn't a string: it is JSON `null`, so it stays distinct from a string column that really holds `"null"`. Among `values` it can only appear in a `D07` entry — `D02`, `D04`, and `D05` all exempt nulls, so their `values` never contain one — but a `keys` entry holds one wherever the primary key itself was null.

`rows`, `keys`, and `values` are each capped, so that a wholly broken column can't turn a report into megabytes of row numbers. The cap is the producer's to choose — the `data-dict` CLI reports the first 50 — and a producer may offer a way to raise or lower it. A cap truncates: what's reported is the first so many in the order the key defines, never a selection drawn from across the table. `count` is never capped, so `count > rows.length` means the list was truncated. The converse doesn't hold — some checks report a count with no rows at all.

### What each check can say

A check reports what its evidence supports, and the evidence differs. These are properties of the checks themselves, not gaps to be worked around:

* `D01` and `D02` can sometimes be settled from Parquet footer statistics alone, without reading a single value. That path proves how many rows offend but not which, so `count` is present and `rows` and `values` are empty.
* `D02`'s `rows` are the rows of the **repeat** occurrences — the row that first held a value is not the one reported as a duplicate — and its `values` follow them, so a key duplicated twice appears twice. A reported value is the key **as stored**, not the form the comparison normalizes it to, so `-0.0` reads as it was written even though it duplicates `0.0`, and two `values` entries that duplicate each other can read differently.
* `D07` on an aggregate assertion (`SUM(x) > 0`) reports `assertion_false`, with no `count` and no `rows`. An aggregate is a single verdict about the whole table, so no row is to blame.
* `D09` reports a single `row`: evaluation stops at the first overflow, since everything after it is computed from a value that already went wrong.
* `D03`, `D06`, and `D08` report that a check *didn't run*, and carry a `reason` naming the barrier rather than any row.

## Restricted columns

A column marked [`display: restricted`](spec.md#display) holds data that must not be surfaced by default. A validation report is user-facing output like any other, and one it is easy to forget: a CI job that archives its reports would otherwise leave restricted values sitting in a build artifact.

So a problem about a restricted column — or about an assertion that reads one — reports `count` and `rows` but no `values`, and sets `"redacted": true`. The rows are still there, so a consumer can still find the offending records in the data it is already entitled to read; only the values are withheld.

Redaction is per column: a restricted column's key is left out of each entry, while its unrestricted neighbours keep their values. The same holds for `keys`: a restricted primary-key column is never attached, and when every key column is restricted `keys` is omitted. If every column the entry would name is restricted — a restricted `enum` or `unique` column, or an assertion that reads nothing else — there is nothing left to say, so `values` is omitted rather than given as a list of empty objects.

`redacted` is always present on the kinds that can carry values or keys, so `"redacted": false` positively states that nothing was withheld.

[Withholding](dev-validation.md#reporting) is a property of validation itself rather than of this format: a restricted column's values are never reported, in a report or in a diagnostic.

## Example

A data-level run over a two-table dictionary, with an unreadable source, a duplicated key, a bad enum value in a restricted column, and a violated assertion:

Grouping that list by `table`, by `column`, or by `code` is a one-liner in any language; here it is in `jq`, collecting every offending row per table:

```bash
jq '.problems | group_by(.table)
   | map({table: .[0].table, rows: (map(.rows // []) | add | unique)})' report.json
```

And a step-by-step table, one row per check with its pass and fail counts:

```bash
jq '.steps | map({step: .id, code, table, columns, outcome, row_count,
                  passed: (if .row_count then .row_count - .failed_row_count else null end),
                  failed_row_count})' report.json
```
