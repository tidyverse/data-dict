# data-dict.yaml

`data-dict.yaml` is a YAML-based data dictionary specification and validator. It describes collections of related tables — their columns, types, constraints, relationships, and domain vocabulary — and is designed to be co-written by humans and AI agents. The main deliverable is a CLI tool that validates data dictionary YAML files against the spec.

The repo contains:

- `site/spec.md`: the full specification (v0.1.0)
- `README.md`: project overview, CLI install/build instructions, and a pointer to the site.
- `site/`: the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) website published to data-dict.tidyverse.org. Holds the spec and design docs (`spec.md`, `semantic-models.md`), as well as example data dictionaries downloaded from other repos (see `download-examples.R`). Built and deployed by `.github/workflows/publish-site.yaml`.
- `crates/`: Rust workspace (see crate architecture below)
- `schema.yaml`: JSON Schema for structural validation of data dictionary files

## Code principles

* Reserve comments for explaining why, not what or how. Default to no comment. Before writing one, check it isn't already said by the item's name, its type, its doc comment, or the line below it — if so, drop it.
* Don't comment on the historical evolution of the code (what it used to do, what changed) or speculate about future work ("we'll handle X later", "grows as Y is added"). Comment only on the code as it stands.
* Keep doc comments to what a caller can't infer from the signature (invariants, units, edge cases, spec rules); don't restate the name.
* User facing code should be accompanied by a test.

## Spec and implementation must stay in sync

The spec (`site/spec.md` + validation details in `site/validation.md`) and the implementation (the crates + `schema.yaml`) are two views of the same thing and must never drift apart.

- **New features start in the spec, and REQUIRE human sign-off.** This is the single most important rule in this file. Any new feature is a two-phase process with a hard stop between the phases:
    1. **Write the spec.** Draft and iterate the change in `site/spec.md` *only*. Do not touch `schema.yaml`, the crates, the tests, or any other file in this phase.
    2. **Stop and get an explicit "yes" from a human on the spec text.** Asking clarifying questions is not sign-off. Presenting a plan is not sign-off. You must show the human the actual spec wording and wait for them to explicitly approve *that wording* before writing a single line of implementation. If you are unsure whether you have approval, you do not have approval — ask again.

  Only after that explicit yes do you implement (`schema.yaml`, crates, tests). Starting implementation before the human has signed off on the spec is a process violation, even if the feature itself is fine.
- **Implementation refinements flow back to the spec.** If you discover during implementation that the spec is wrong, incomplete, or ambiguous, update `site/spec.md` to match what you actually built.
- **Touch one, check the other.** Whenever you change the spec, double-check the implementation still matches; whenever you change the implementation, update the spec. A change to either is incomplete until both agree.

## Crate architecture

Rust workspace with three crates:

- `crates/data-dict/` — core library: YAML parsing, spec validation, lowering to typed model, and semantic checks. All logic lives here.
- `crates/data-dict-cli/` — thin CLI wrapper (`validate-spec` / `validate-meta` / `validate-data`, plus `types parquet`). Keep it thin.
- `crates/data-dict-parquet/` — reads Parquet file schemas and maps column types to data-dict types.

### Validation levels

The three levels and every check code (`S##` / `M##` / `D##`) are defined in `site/validation.md` — the single source of truth. Don't re-document the checks here or in code comments; point to that file. Each level implies the ones before it.

Implementation, one module per level (entry points re-exported at the crate root):

| Level | Module | CLI |
|-------|--------|-----|
| spec (`S##`) | `validate_spec.rs` — structural check against `schema.yaml`, then the semantic `S` checks | `validate-spec` |
| metadata (`M##`) | `validate_meta.rs` | `validate-meta` |
| data (`D##`) | `validate_data.rs` | `validate-data` |

Every level reports through one vocabulary in `problem.rs`: a `Problem` (a `code`, `severity`, `message`, optional `expected`/`column`/`hint`/`span`, and a flattened `ProblemKind` tag covering pre-flight, spec, metadata, and data findings alike) and a `ProblemSet` (one vector of them plus the `SourceContext` for rendering). `serde` derives the JSON wire format directly; there is no separate error type. "Fatal" is not a field — a level pushes its problems and returns early to stop the run, and the meta/data levels descend only while `ProblemSet::has_errors()` is false. `Level`, the `select_tables` helper, and the `compare_dataset`/`read_parquet` driver live in `lib.rs`. Each level's entry point drives its own flow (no central dispatcher).

Test fixtures for the spec rules are in `crates/data-dict/tests/fixtures/{valid,invalid,spec}/`. Each fixture has a `# expected: ...` header documenting the intended outcome. Integration tests mirror the levels: `tests/validate_spec.rs` / `validate_meta.rs` / `validate_data.rs`.

### Problem reporting

Two principles guide how problems are surfaced:

- **Full context.** A problem should carry enough context that the user can see at a glance where it comes from — point at the offending span and fade in its enclosing nodes (e.g. the table and column a bad value sits in), so the location is unambiguous without re-reading the file.
- **Report as many problems as possible at once.** Prefer collecting all the problems in a pass over bailing on the first, so the user fixes them together rather than rerunning repeatedly. Not always possible (a problem can block the checks that would follow it), but worth striving for.

### Diagnostic wording

A diagnostic is split across two parts: `expected` is a general statement of the problem, and `message` reports what was found at the offending location. `expected` leads the rendering (the title line beside the code for span-located spec problems; the headline line for the plain-rendered metadata/data problems) and `message` follows it. Prefer this split whenever a general rule can be stated, at every level (`S`/`M`/`D`).

- `expected` is one concise but informative statement, in sentence case, ending with a full stop. State what *must* hold when the cause is clear (e.g. an incorrect type or size: "A range's minimum must be less than or equal to its maximum."); use *can't* when you can't state what was expected.
- `message` (the "found" detail) is a lowercase fragment with no full stop — it names the concrete value or location ("minimum `100` is greater than maximum `10`").
- Diagnostic hints always start with a capital letter.

If a schema change causes `site/examples/` to fail, don't fix them. Instead report them to me so I can fix upstream.


## Data format

- Keys in `data-dict.yaml` use snake_case (e.g. `primary_key`, `foreign_key`, `$learn_more`).

## Prose

- Use sentence case for headings.

- If the user asks you to proofread a file, act as an expert proofreader and editor with a deep understanding of clear, engaging, and well-structured writing.

  Work paragraph by paragraph, always starting by making a TODO list that includes individual items for each top-level section.

  Fix spelling, grammar, and other minor problems without asking the user. Label any unclear, confusing, or ambiguous sentences with a FIXME comment.

  Only report what you have changed.


## Code

- Use nanoparquet for reading/writing parquet files (R code).
